# COSI116 Final Project - Undergrad Group 2

# About
This project showcases an interactive web application that combines a map, bar chart, and line graph to visualize the percentage of areas with safe water access in different regions, including urban and rural breakdowns. Users can explore the data by hovering over the map and observing how it dynamically links to the bar chart and line graph.

# Features
Interactive Map: Hover over map regions to view details and interact with associated charts.
Bar Chart: Displays the proportion of areas with safe water access for selected regions.
Line Graph: Shows the historical trends of safe water access percentages for all areas, urban, and rural categories.
Getting Started

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mrseph34/COSI116_FinalProject_UndergradGroup2.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Usage
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

Hover over map regions or vice versa to see dynamic updates in the bar chart and line graph.

# - Interactive Water Access Visualization -
Welcome to our interactive water access visualization! This tool provides a comprehensive view of safe drinking water percentages across different regions. Dive into the details by exploring the following features:

# - Map Interaction -

Hover over Map Regions:
Hover over specific regions on the map to reveal key information about safe water access percentages.
The highlighted region will dynamically update the associated bar chart and line graph.

# - Bar Chart -
Dynamic Updates:
As you hover over map regions, the bar chart reflects real-time changes based on the selected region.
The bars represent the proportion of safe drinking water in the chosen region.

Color-Coded Bars:
Each bar is color-coded to represent a specific region, facilitating easy identification.
Legend: A x axis legend is provided to match colors with corresponding regions.

# - Line Graph - 

Temporal Trends:
The line graph illustrates historical trends in safe drinking water percentages.
It includes separate lines for overall, urban, and rural areas, providing a comprehensive overview.

# - Additional Features - 

Global Overview:
Observe the overall safe water access percentage globally without highlighting any specific region.

Legend:
The legend indicates the color codes for different regions, making it easy to interpret the map and bar chart.

Titles:
The map, bar chart, and line graph each have informative titles to guide users and provide context.

Highlighting Effect:
When interacting with the graphs, a highlighting effect is applied to the selected region, making it visually distinct.
For example, highlighted regions on the map outline red, and corresponding bars in the bar chart and points in the line graph are emphasized.

Customization
If you want to customize or extend the project, you can modify the code in the respective JavaScript files. Refer to the comments in the code for guidance.
