    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Our visualization project aims to address the critical issue of safe drinking water accessibility across different regions globally. The project recognizes the importance of visualizing data to gain insights into the disparities and improvements in water accessibility over the years.
    </p>

    <h2>User Needs</h2>
    <p>
        To effectively meet the needs of our users, we considered the following key requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Geographical Understanding:</strong> Users should be able to explore and understand safe water percentages across various regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal Analysis:</strong> Users should have the capability to analyze trends and changes in safe water accessibility over different years.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> The visualization should facilitate the comparison of safe water percentages between different regions and time periods.</li>
        <li><strong>Insightful Exploration:</strong> Users should be able to hover over map regions and related visualizations to gain detailed information and insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Motivating Questions</h2>
    <p>
        The visualization is designed to address the following motivating questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>How has safe drinking water accessibility changed globally over the past years?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>What are the regional disparities in safe water percentages, and how have they evolved?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Are there specific regions that have shown significant improvements or declines in safe water accessibility?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>How does the safe water situation vary between urban and rural areas?</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        By focusing on these user needs and motivating questions, our visualization provides a comprehensive understanding of the global landscape of safe drinking water accessibility.

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            The data for our COSI116 Final Project is sourced from reputable organizations to ensure accuracy and relevance to the problem statement.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>World Geo JSON Data:</strong> Provided by Johan Merge, it forms the basis for our choropleth map visualization.</li>
            <li><strong>UN Stats Clean Water Accessibility:</strong> Offers comprehensive data on safe drinking water percentages across regions and years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset includes the following key data types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Numeric Data:</strong> Safe water percentages are represented as numerical values, forming the basis for visualizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Categorical Data:</strong> Regions and locations are represented as categorical data, facilitating geographical analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Data:</strong> Time-related information allows for the exploration of trends over the years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure the dataset's suitability for visualization, we performed the following preprocessing steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Removal of any irrelevant or incomplete entries to maintain data integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Combining data from different sources to create a unified dataset for visualization.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> Aggregating data at various levels (regional, temporal) for meaningful visualizations.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The processed data is then used in our choropleth map, bar chart, and line chart visualizations to effectively communicate insights into safe drinking water accessibility.
        </p>
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    
    <h2>Domain Tasks</h2>
    <p>

        <li><strong>Temporal Exploration:</strong> Allowing users to explore temporal patterns in safe water accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p>
      Our visualization journey involved iterative improvements guided by principles of information visualization. We carefully considered visual encodings, marks, and channels to enhance user understanding of safe drinking water accessibility data.
  </p>

  <h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
  <p>
      Our initial sketches focused on exploring different visual encodings to represent safe water percentages across regions and years. We experimented with various mark types and channels to find the most effective way to communicate the data.
  </p>

  <h2>Visual Encodings</h2>
  <p>
      Through iterative design, we opted for a choropleth map as the primary visual encoding. The use of color gradients on map regions serves as an effective channel to represent variations in safe water percentages. We carefully selected color schemes to ensure intuitive interpretation, with blue hues representing higher percentages.
  </p>

  <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
  <p>
      Marks in our visualization include map polygons, bars in the bar chart, and lines in the temporal line graph. Each mark is strategically chosen to convey specific data attributes. For instance, the length of bars in the bar chart serves as a channel to represent the proportion of safe water, while the position of the line on the y-axis in the line graph depicts the percentage over time.
  </p>

  <h2>Iterative Improvements</h2>
  <p>
      Feedback from usability testing played a crucial role in our iterative design process. Users' interactions guided adjustments in color choices, mark sizes, and overall layout. The goal was to create a visually appealing and intuitive visualization that effectively communicates the story within the data.
  </p>

  <h2>Interactive Features</h2>
  <p>
      To enhance user engagement, we introduced interactive features such as hover effects. Hovering over map regions dynamically updates related bar chart and line graph elements, facilitating comparative analysis. These interactive channels provide users with a more immersive and exploratory experience.
  </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>
            Our project aimed to provide a comprehensive visualization of safe drinking water accessibility data, allowing users to explore patterns and trends across regions and years. Through the implementation of interactive visualizations, we sought to create an engaging and informative user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Completed Work</h2>
        <p>
            The project successfully implemented a choropleth map, bar chart, and line graph to represent safe water percentages. Interactive features, such as brushing and dynamic updates, enhance user interaction and exploration. The integration of visual encodings, marks, and channels aligns with principles of information visualization, resulting in a visually appealing and effective representation of the data.
        </p>

        <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
        <p>
            While the project has achieved its primary objectives, there are areas for improvement. User feedback highlighted potential enhancements in color choices, tooltips, and additional contextual information. Improving the responsiveness and performance of the visualizations, especially with larger datasets, is another consideration for future iterations.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Future work could focus on expanding the dataset to include more granular information, mainly seeing the names of areas on the map but then also things such as water source types or regional policies impacting water accessibility. Further refinement of the user interface and additional visual analytics features could contribute to a more robust and user-friendly tool. Collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders would also ensure the visualization aligns with real-world implications and policy discussions.
